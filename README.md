* Keeping notes of a few books / articles that I've read
* I've found that I learn better when taking notes - this repository is mostly for my own consumption but thought that I might as well share it
* When writing notes, I try to:
    - Not deviate too much from the orginal article, typically keeping the structure of the original article
    - Write self sufficient notes
    - Not write something that I don't understand
